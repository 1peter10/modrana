= Intro =
Each theme is represented with its own folder. Name of the folder is used as theme name.
The theme folder can contain icons and the theme.conf configuration file
for setting colors of the cairo drawn GUI components.
See the self documented theme.conf in the default theme.

= How icon loading works ? =
Icons are first looked up in the current theme folder, if not available
the default folder is looked up. If no icon is found in both folders,
a generic icon is used.

= What image fomats can the icons be in ? =
Currently only png is supported, but support for other bitmap formats and SVG is planed.
When deciding on icon resolution, look on the resolutiton of the default icons,
icons are always scaled to fit the current iccon size.

= Where are the source SVG files for the default icons ? =
They are in data/gui_source.
